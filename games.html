        The main fallout games have been developed by many different companies over the years with various fans telling you different things, many of the "old school" fans may say the original games devoloped by Black Isle Studios are the best as they are the most authentic to the genre of RPGs.<br>
        As when Bethesda got the IP their approach may not have been to the preference of the older fans as it changes up the perspective and is a bit more action based but still has a lot of RPG elements. For many Fallout 3 was the entry point into the series and as such has become many peoples favourite. <br />
        After Fallout 3 the licenese was then handed over to Obesidan studios who got just about 2 years to make a fallout game, which became fallout New Vegas. This entry boosted the RPG aspects whilst keeping what fallout 3 had improve upon already  which is what made it the perfect fallout for many fans <br />
        which couldn't have made bethesda very happy as it doesn't look likely they will every loan out the license again. since new evags they has been two entries, fallout 4 and fallout 76. Fallout 4 being fairly well recieved but still being critisised for not being enough of a RPG Fallout 76 has been the most recent <br />
        entry and by far the most disapointing to fans as it was simply Fallout 4, a games engine used for single player games, made into an online multiplayer game. This to say the least became a glitchy mess very quickly and since has released contents and bug fixes but its not liekly to recover.

        The side fallout games are few in numbers as these are very much sort of imbetween, between the main games with none of these being canon to the fallout universe. Fallout Tactics was released after 2 but not made by Black Isle Studios, while not being praised as a great fallout it still has its<br />
        fanbase. Then on the other there is Fallout Brotherhood of steel which is seen as the worst Fallout, not having barely any RPG elements and just being a plain bad game many struggle to get through due to the pure monotony that the game is. Fallout shelter is quite different from the other <br />
        spin-off games as its a mobile game, though not being of huge signifiance anf being a farely simple resource managment game it is still quite fun and was released just before Fallout 4 to get back into the minds of people before its big release.

    <p> The fallout games have been developed by many different companies with various fans telling <br /> you different things, many 
    maybe "old school" fans may say the original games devoloped by Black Isle Studios are the best as they are the most authentic to the genre that was RPG.<br />
    As when Bethesda got the IP their approach may benot to be the preference of newer fans as it changes up the perspective and is a bit more action based but still has a lot of RPG elements. For many Fallout 3 was the entry point into the series
    and as such has become many peoples favourite. The licenese was then handed over to Obesidan studios who got just about 2 years to make a fallout game, which became fallout New Vegas. This entry boosted the RPG aspects whilst keeping what fallout 3 had improveupon<br />
    which is what made it the perfect fallout for many fans which I am sure worried Bethesda who had only recently purchased the IP. THis to an extent leaves little hope for many fallout New Vegas fans that they wil get another great entry from their preffered devoloper<br /></p>
